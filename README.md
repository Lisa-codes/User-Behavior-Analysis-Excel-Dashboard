# User-Behavior-Analysis-Excel-Dashboard
Overview

This project explores user behaviour data from 2023 to 2025 using SQL and Excel. The main goal was to uncover insights on app performance and user engagement by analysing review data across different categories, demographics, and versions.

Objectives

Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.

Identify and track key performance indicators (KPIs).

Build an interactive Excel dashboard for year-to-year and demographic analysis.

Tools Used

SQL → for querying, filtering, and summarising data.

Excel (Power Query & PivotTables/Charts) → for data cleaning, transformations, and dashboard creation.

Data Preparation Steps
